    <h1 id="nvu_tutorial">KompoZer Tutorial</h1>

    <p>KompoZer is an open source
    What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get(WYSIWYG) complete web authoring
    system. It is based on Gecko, the Mozilla rendering
    engine. KompoZer is completely free and can be downloaded
    from <a href="http://www.nvu.com/">KompoZer
    website</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="scope_of_this_tutorial">Scope of This Tutorial</h2>

    <p>This tutorial is designed for beginners, who are new to web
    page designing with a WYSIWYG editor. The tutorial provides just
    enough help so as to get you started with using KompoZer
    for your web page design purposes. It is not an introduction to
    HTML, XHTML, CSS, etc. coding. Its only aim is to give you a kick
    start on how to use KompoZer.</p>

    <p>The manual does not even cover all the basic aspects of HTML in
    detail. Yes, this is a short tutorial and some basic albeit
    unimportant things have been left out. You are encouraged to find
    out about them yourself. Also the tutorial covers just an
    introduction on how to use cascading style sheets with the inbuilt
    editor, CaScadeS.</p>

    <p>For those of you who are more interested in learning about
    HTML, CSS, etc in detail you can go to the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/">W3 Consortium website</a>. There you
    will find detailed information about various standards maintained
    by them. You can also do a search on the WWW or refer to one of
    the many books available on learning HTML.</p>

    <!-- The approach of this tutorial is to give the most basic
         instructions on getting major things done with Nvu. This will
         give the user an idea as to how to achieve the objective of
         the secion. In the end of each section a link should be
         provided targetting corresponding section in the main Help
         for detailed treatment of the same objective.-->

    <h3 id="in_this_tutorial">In This Tutorial</h3>

    <p>This tutorial first introduces you to KompoZer's User
    Interface. This is followed by a basic formatting section. Next
    section, tells you how to insert elements like images, tables, and
    forms in your document. Then we have small section devoted to
    styling your document using CSS. The document concludes with
    instructions for publishing your document to a web server.</p>

    <p>[ <a href="#scope_of_this_tutorial">Return to beginning of
    section</a> ]</p>

    <h2 id="introduction_to_the_user_interface">Introduction to the
    User Interface</h2>

    <p>KompoZer's File Menu contains menu items for all major
    operations possible while using it. For full detailed reference
    read the <a href="menu_reference.html">Menu Reference</a>
    page. KompoZer's tool bar user interface consists of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#composition_toolbar">Composition Toolbar</a></li>
      <li><a href="#format_toolbar">Format Toolbar</a></li>
      <li><a href="#tab_browser_toolbar">Tab Browser Toolbar</a></li>
      <li><a href="#edit_mode_toolbar">Edit Mode Toolbar</a></li>
      <li><a href="#status_toolbar">Status Toolbar</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="composition_toolbar">Composition Toolbar</h3>

    <p>The Composition Toolbar consists of buttons for the most used major operations. Below is the a snapshot of the default Composition Toolbar with text below each button indicating the respective button's function.</p>

    <p><img src="images/tut_composition_tb.png" title="Composition Toolbar" alt="" /></p>

    <h3 id="format_toolbar">Format Toolbar</h3>

    <p>The Format Toolbar is a very useful tool while editing web
    pages with KompoZer. With the Format Toolbar you can apply
    paragraph format, choose a font, change foreground or background
    colour, increase or decrease size, and emphasize a block of
    text. You can also create ordered or unordered lists and justify a
    block of text to left, right or centre. To know which button does
    what just hover your mouse over the button and a tool tip will
    appear indicating the function of the button.</p>

    <p><img src="images/tut_formating_tb.png" title="Formating Toolbar" alt="" /></p>

    <h3 id="tab_browser_toolbar">Tab Browser Toolbar</h3>

    <p>KompoZer allows you to simultaneously edit multiple web
    documents using different tabs for each opened document. Having
    multiple tabs gives a cleaner look to your desktop as it is not
    cluttered when multiple windows are used for each document. As a
    visual indicator a "<em>red floppy icon</em>" icon appears for
    pages which have been edited but not saved yet.</p>

    <p><img src="images/tut_tabbrowser_tb.png" title="Tab Browser Toolbar" alt="" /></p>

    <h3 id="edit_mode_toolbar">Edit Mode Toolbar</h3>

    <p>The Edit Mode Toolbar indicates the viewing mode which is
    presently active for the current document. Available viewing modes
    are the Normal view, HTML Tags view, HTML source view and the
    Preview mode. You can easily change your viewing mode by simply
    clicking any of the other three with the mouse.</p>

    <p><img src="images/tut_editmode_tb.png" title="Edit Mode Toolbar" alt="" /></p>

    <h3 id="status_toolbar">Status Toolbar</h3>

    <p>KompoZer's status bar shows the position of the cursor
    with respect to the HTML tag hierarchy. You can easily edit/assign
    the properties of any particular tag in the status bar just by
    right clicking and choosing the desired option. Simple left-click
    of the mouse on a tag in status bar selects the text surrounded by
    that tag.</p>

    beginning of section</a> ]</p>

    <h2 id="starting_a_new_document">Starting a New Document</h2>

    <p>You can start a new document by either clicking on the "New"
    button on the composition toolbar or by clicking File > New and
    select "Blank Document" and then click on "Create". In case you
    want to edit an existing file use File > Open and choose the file
    you want to edit. For detailed instructions, refer to <a
    href="composer_help.html#starting_a_new_page">Starting a New
    Page</a> section in the KompoZer Help documentation.</p>

    <p>You can also start a new document which is a template instead
    of a normal html file. Templates are used to make website
    management easier as the maintainer will only need to edit the
    text for a particular page and not worry about the design as it is
    controlled by the template. This tutorial will not go further into
    creating and using templates. Further information about templates
    can be obtained from the <a
    href="composer_help.html#working_with_templates">Working with
    Templates</a> section of KompoZer Help documentation.</p>

    <h2 id="basic_formatting_of_the_document">Basic Formatting of the
    Document</h2>

    <p>We will use the text given in the next section in the new
    document to follow the formatting help in this tutorial. The text
    will used as a base to learn basic formatting functions available
    in KompoZer. Copy the text from the following section and
    paste it in your new document.</p>

    <h3 id="tutorial_text">Tutorial Text</h3>

    <!-- The text for the tutorial is a general text. It was by chance
         that I was reading a book by Jim Corbett when I was planning
         about the text to be used for the tutorial. So I wrote a few
         paragraphs with the information I collected from a couple of
         books and several websites. I donot guarantee for the
         information to be correct. So, if you want detailed
         information about Corbett National Park, consult tourist
         books, and the WWW. In case you want to change the text,
         please make sure that neither the new text is not copyrighted
         nor you should use copyrighted images. All text and images

    <p>Corbett National Park</p>

    <p>Corbett National Park, named in the memory of Jim Corbett, was
    created in 1938 and was the first national park to be established
    in Asia. It is situated in the northern state of Uttranchal in
    India. It has an area of 512 sq. km. The combined area of Corbett
    National Park, Sonandi Wildlife sanctuary and Reserve Forest areas
    summing up to 1288 sq. km. constitute a bigger project called
    Corbett Tiger Reserve.</p>

    <p>The most famous animals of Corbett National Park are the Bengal
    Tiger and the Asiatic elephant. It is also a home to other animals
    like etc etc. Situated at the junction of the Garhwal and Kumaon
    hill regions it also boasts of the combination of cultures of
    people of both regions.</p>

    <p>Jim Corbett</p>

    <p>Jim Corbett, (1825-19), lived in Kaladhungi. His house has been
    converted into a museum by the government as a dedication to his
    life and times. He was a naturalist, conservationalist and an avid
    photographer. Born on 25th July 1875, he grew up in Kaladhungi and
    Nanital. After fighting for the British army in the WWI, he came
    back to India and settled in Kaladhungi with his sister,
    Maggie. He was called up several times by village people and the
    government to get rid of man-eating tigers and leopards.</p>

    <p>Visiting Corbett National Park</p>

    <p>General Information</p>

    <p>Altitude: 385-1100m above sea level</p>

    <p>Annual Rainfall: 1400mm - 2800mm</p>

    <p>Temperature range: 4C in winter to 42C in summer.</p>

    <p>Open for tourists from 15 November to 15 June.</p>

    <p>Getting there:</p>

    <p>The head quarters of Corbett Tiger Reserver are at Ramnagar. By
    road it is connected to Delhi, Moradabad, Bareilly and
    Nanital. State transport buses ply from Delhi, Moradabad and
    Haldwani to Ramnagar. By rail tourists can reach Ramnagar by
    taking a train from New Delhi.</p>

    <h3>Formatting the text</h3>

    <p>The first thing we will take care of are the headings and
    subheadings. Select the text "Corbett National Park" at the top of
    the document and click on the <em>Body Text</em> drop down menu on
    the <strong>Format Toolbar</strong> and select <tt>Heading
    1</tt>. The text will be styled according to the default Heading
    Level-1 style. Similarly, select the text "Visiting Corbett
    National Park" and make it a level-2 heading.</p>

    <p>The second you might want to do is to select entire paragraphs
    in your text and mark them <em>paragraph</em> following same
    procedure for the headings. In the given text this has already
    done to make the text more presentable, but otherwise marking
    paragraphs separately is a good practice.</p>

    <p>You can also style important words or phrases using the
    <strong>bold</strong>(<strong>B</strong>),
    <em>italic</em>(<strong><em>I</em></strong>), or
    <u>underline</u>(<strong><u>U</u></strong>) buttons on the
    <strong>Format Toolbar</strong>, as has been done in this
    line. Several other options of formatting your text are available
    from the Format Toolbar or via the Format menu on the File Menu
    toolbar. Go ahead and try to use a few options, you will learn a
    few trick this way. If you mess up, don't worry, just click
    "<tt>Ctrl+Z</tt>" once to <em>undo</em> your last action. For
    detailed instructions about all the ways possible to format text
    for a web page, see <a
    href="composer_help.html#formatting_your_web_pages">Formatting
    your Web Pages</a> section in KompoZer Help
    documentation.</p>

    <p>At this stage, your tutorial text should look similar to
    this:</p>

    <h2 id="inserting_images_and_tables">Inserting Images, and
    Tables</h2>

    <p>Images, tables and forms can be inserted/created in your
    document using the <strong>Composition Toolbar</strong>. Let us
    insert a table and copy the General Information about Corbett
    National Park into it. Click on the "<em>Table</em>" button <img src="images/table.png" alt="" /> on the
    composition toolbar. And choose the table dimensions to be 5 rows
    and 2 columns with your mouse. Clicking on the 5th row in 2nd
    column will create a default table with those dimensions.</p>

    <p>To fill the table with our pre-written text, just cut
    ("<tt>Ctrl+X</tt>") the corresponding text and paste
    ("<tt>Ctrl+V</tt>") it in corresponding cell of the table. After
    you are done, the table should look like the one below:</p>

    <!-- Do not remove inline styles from tutorial text.
	 This is to override the style sheet rules.-->

    <table style="text-align: left; height: 301px; width: 655px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

    <p>With the basic table constructed, you can change the table
    properties by activating the table i.e. bring the cursor in the
    table and then click on the "<strong>Table</strong>" button on the
    <strong>Composition Toolbar</strong>. In the Table Properties
    dialog, you can set various properties for the table, cell, row or
    a column, e.g. background colour for table or cell, table caption,
    table alignment, table or column width, etc.</p>
