<h1 id="publishing_web_pages_with_nvu">Publishing Web Pages with KompoZer</h1>

<p>If your pages exist only on your local hard disk, you can privately
view your HTML pages. KompoZer lets you publish
your pages to a remote computer called a web server.</p>

<p>When you publish your pages to a web server, KompoZer
copies (uploads) your pages to a computer that lets others browse your
pages. Most ISPs provide space on their web servers for web page
publishing. To find a web server where you can publish your pages, ask
your ISP, help desk, or system administrator.</p>

<h2 id="publishing_a_document">Publishing a Document</h2>

<p>To publish a document:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the HTML document that you want to publish, or create a new
  KompoZer document.</li>

  <li>When you're ready to publish the document remotely, click the
  Publish button <img src="images/publish.png" alt="" />. 

  <p>If you have published this document before, KompoZer
  remembers the document's publishing settings and starts publishing the
  document. While publishing is in progress, KompoZer displays a
  publishing status dialog box.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you have never published this document before,
    KompoZer displays the Settings tab
    in the Publish Page dialog box so you can enter
    information about the document's remote
    publishing location. See <a
    href="#publish_page_settings">Publish Page - Settings</a> for more
    information. When you're done entering information, click
    Publish.</li>

    <li>If you have never saved the document, KompoZer
    displays the Publish tab in the Publish
    Page dialog box, so you can enter the document's
    filename. See
    <a href="#publish_page_publish">Publish Page - Publish</a>
    for more information.
    After entering the filename, click Publish.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>To browse your published page, click the Browse button. Test the
  page's links and make
  sure there are no missing images.</li>

  <li>Continue editing the page as necessary. When you're ready to
  update the remote page
  with your changes, click the Publish button.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you publish a document for the first time, KompoZer
changes the document's <tt>file:///</tt> URL to an <tt>http://</tt>
URL to indicate that you are now editing the published document. If
you want to save the document locally (on your computer's hard disk),
click the Save button. You'll be prompted to choose a filename and
location on your hard disk for the document.</p>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#publishing_a_document">Return to beginning of
section</a> ]</p>

<h3 id="avoiding_broken_links_or_images">Tips for Avoiding Broken
Links or Missing Images</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure your KompoZer filenames end with the .html
  or .htm file extension. Make sure your image filenames end with the
  .JPG, .GIF, or .PNG file extension. Don't use spaces or other special
  symbols in your filenames. Keep your filenames short and only use
  lowercase or uppercase letters and numbers.</li>

  <li>If your images appear as broken links when you browse a document
  on the web server, you may have forgotten to include the images when
  you published. Open the File menu, and choose Publish As to display
  the Publish Page dialog box. In the Publish tab, make sure you check
  "Include images and other files" and then click Publish.</li>
</ul>

Publishing Problems</a>.</p>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#publishing_a_document">Return to beginning of

<h3 id="updating_a_published_document">Updating a Published
Document</h3>

<p>To update a published document:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a KompoZer window, open the File menu, and choose
  Recent Pages, then select the
  document from the list. <p>Alternatively, browse to the location
  of the document you
  want to update by entering the document's HTTP address (the
  document's web address)
  in the Navigator browser's Location field.</p></li>
  
  <li>Open the File menu, and choose Edit Page.</li>

  <li>Edit the document as necessary.</li>

  <li>When you're ready to update the remote page with your changes,
  click Publish in KompoZer's toolbar.</li>
</ol>

<p id="deleting_a_published_page_or_image"><strong>Tip</strong>: To
delete a page or image you've published on a web server, you must use
an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program. You also must use an FTP
program if you want to create subdirectories or to rename files on the
web server. Ask your service provider if they recommend a particular
FTP program. You can usually find information on FTP programs in the
Help or Support sections of your service provider's web site. FTP
programs are also available from shareware sites such as ZDNet
Downloads.</p>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a

<h3 id="changing_the_filename_or_publishing_location">Changing the
Filename or Publishing Location</h3>

<p>To change a document's filename or publishing location:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a KompoZer window, open the File menu, and choose
  Recent Pages, then select the
  document from the list. <p>Alternatively, browse to the location
  of the document you
  want to update by entering the document's HTTP address (the
  document's web address)
  in the Navigator browser's Location field.</p></li>
  
  <li>Open the File menu, and choose Edit Page.</li>
  
  <li>Edit the document as necessary.</li>

  <li>Open KompoZer's File menu and choose Publish
  As. KompoZer displays the Publish tab
  in the Publish Page dialog box.</li>

  <li>Enter a different page title, if necessary.</li>

  <li>Enter a different filename for the page, if necessary.</li>

  <li>From the Site Name list, choose the publishing location you want
  to use. To set up a new
  publishing location, click New Site. See
  <a href="#publish_page_settings">Publish Page - Settings</a>
  for more information.</li>

  <li>Click Publish to save the document to the new location.</li>
</ol>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#publishing_a_document">Return to beginning of
section</a> ]</p>

<h3 id="creating_a_new_publishing_site">Creating a New Publishing
Site</h3>

<p>If you plan to publish documents to more than one remote location,
you can set up KompoZer to save the publishing information for
each remote site you use, so that you don't have to enter it each time
you want to publish.</p>

<p>To create a new publishing site, begin from a KompoZer
window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Publishing Site Settings.
  KompoZer displays the Publish Settings dialog box.</li>

  <li>Click New Site.</li>

  <li>For "Site Name," enter the nickname by which you want to refer to
  this publishing site.

  <p>For example, if you will use the new site to publish documents
  related to the "Meteor" project, you might want to use the site name
  "Meteor". Site names remind you about the types of documents you
  publish at each site.</p> </li>

  <li>For "Publishing address," enter the complete URL provided to you
  by your ISP, system administrator, or web hosting service. This URL
  must begin with either <tt>ftp://</tt> or <tt>http://</tt>.

  <p>The publishing address specifies the location where documents are
  published (uploaded) at this site. If you are not sure what to enter,
  ask your ISP or system administrator.</p> </li>

  <li>For "HTTP address of your home page," enter the complete URL that
  you would enter in the Navigator browser to view pages at this
  site. Do not include a filename or subdirectory as part of the URL.


  <p>This URL must always begin with <tt>http://</tt>. In some cases,
  this URL is the same as the publishing address. If you are not sure
  what to enter, ask your ISP or system administrator, or else leave it
  blank.</p> </li>

  <li>For user name, enter the user name you use to log in to your ISP
  or web hosting service.</li>

  <li>For password, enter the password for your user name.</li>

  <li>Select "Save Password" to save your password securely using
  Password Manager so that you don't have to enter it each time you
  publish pages at this site.</li>

  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#publishing_a_document">Return to beginning of
section</a> ]</p>

<h3 id="changing_the_default_publishing_site">Changing the Default
Publishing Site</h3>

<p>If you have set up more than one publishing site, but you typically
use only one site for most of your publishing needs, you can designate
the site you use most often as the default publishing
site. KompoZer will use the default publishing site for all
documents that you publish, unless you specifically choose an
alternate site.</p>

<p>Regardless of how many sites you've set up, you can always publish
a document to a different site by choosing Publish As from
KompoZer's File menu. See <a
href="#changing_the_filename_or_publishing_location">Changing the
Filename or Publishing Location</a> for more information.</p>

<p>To choose the default publishing site, begin from a
KompoZer window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Publishing Site Settings.
  KompoZer displays the Publish Settings dialog box.</li>

  <li>Select a publishing site from the list.

  <p>If you only have one publishing site set up, KompoZer uses
  that one as the default site.</p> </li>

  <li>Click Set as Default.</li>

<li>Click OK to confirm your changes.</li> </ol>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#publishing_a_document">Return to beginning of
section</a> ]</p>

<h3 id="deleting_a_publishing_site">Deleting a Publishing Site</h3>

<p>Deleting a publishing site removes the site's settings from
KompoZer. If you later wish to publish to the site, you must
re-enter the site's settings.</p>

<p>To delete a publishing site's settings, begin from a
KompoZer window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Publishing Site
  Settings. KompoZer displays the Publish
  Settings dialog box.</li>
  
  <li>Select a publishing site from the list.</li>
  
  <li>Click Remove Site.
  <p>KompoZer only removes the site's settings; the remote
  site itself is not
  affected.</p></li>

  <li>Click OK to confirm your changes.</li>
</ol>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#publishing_a_document">Return to beginning of

<h2 id="publishing_settings">Publishing Settings</h2>

<p>This section describes KompoZer's publishing settings. For
information on KompoZer's general and new page settings, see
<a href="composer_help.html#composer_preferences">KompoZer Preferences</a>.</p>

<h3 id="publish_page_publish">Publish Page - Publish</h3>

<p>The Publish Page - Publish tab lets you specify where you want to
publish a document. These settings apply to the current document.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Publish Page - Publish tab,
follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Publish As. The Publish Page
  dialog box appears.</li>

  <li>Click the Publish tab.</li>
</ol>

<ul> <li><strong>Site Name:</strong> Lists all the publishing sites
you've created, so you can choose the site that you want to publish
to. To create a new site, click New Site.</li>

<li><strong>Page Title:</strong> Specifies the document's page title
as it appears in the browser window's title bar when you view the page
in the browser. The document's page title also appears in your list of
bookmarks if you bookmark the page.</li>

<li><strong>Filename:</strong> Specifies the document's filename. Make
sure you include the .html or .htm extension in the filename.</li>

<li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
    list-style-image: none;"> <p><strong>Warning</strong>: If a file on
    the remote site you're publishing to has the same filename as one
    you're uploading, the newly uploaded file will replace the existing
one. You will not be asked to confirm the action.</p> </li>

<li><strong>Site subdirectory for this page:</strong> If you leave
this blank, KompoZer publishes the page to the main (root)
publishing directory at this site. If you want to publish the page to
a remote subdirectory that resides underneath the main publishing
directory at this site, enter the name of the subdirectory or choose
it from the list. KompoZer keeps track of the locations you
type here, so you can select from a list of remote locations you've
previously used. Keep in mind that subdirectory names are
case-sensitive.</li>

<li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
    list-style-image: none;"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The site
    subdirectory you choose must already exist at the remote server.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Include images and other files</strong>: If checked,
KompoZer publishes any images and other files referenced by
this page. You can choose to publish these files to the same location
as the page, or else you can choose to publish these files into a
remote subdirectory that exists underneath the main publishing
directory.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To create remote subdirectories or delete
published pages or images, you must use an FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) program. Ask your service provider if they recommend a
particular FTP program. You can usually find information on FTP
programs in the Help or Support sections of your service provider's
web site. FTP programs are also available from shareware sites such as
ZDNet Downloads.</p>

<h2 id="solving_common_publishing_problems">Solving Common Publishing
Problems</h2>

<p>If any of your files fails to publish, the Publishing Status
dialog box displays an error message that can help you determine what
went wrong and how to fix it. Click the Troubleshooting button in the
Publishing Status dialog box to get help on solving your publishing
problem.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to publish a file, save the file to your
hard disk by opening KompoZer's File menu, and choosing
Save. You can then open the file at a later time to try to publish
it. To quickly locate the file later, open KompoZer's File
menu, and choose Recent Pages.</p>

<h3 id="verifying_your_publishing_settings">Verifying Your Publishing
Settings</h3>

<p>To verify your publishing settings:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Close the Publishing Status dialog box, if it is open.</li>

  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Publishing Site Settings.</li>

  <li>In the Publish Settings dialog box, confirm that the site settings
  are correct for the site you are trying to publish to. If you're not
  sure, check with your ISP or web hosting service.</li>

  <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside;
      list-style-image: none;"> <ul> <li><strong>Verify that you correctly
      entered the publishing settings.</strong> You may have accidentally
      mistyped one of the settings.</li>

      <li><strong>Verify that you entered the correct publishing
      address.</strong> Web hosting services or ISPs may refer to the
      publishing address as the "server name", the "hostname", or the
      "server/host". They often specify the publishing location as
      <tt>ftp.myisp.com/username</tt>, where <tt>username</tt> is your user
      name.

      <p>For the publishing address to be correct, you must precede the
      publishing location with either <tt>ftp://</tt> or
      <tt>http://</tt>. For example, the correct publishing address for the
      above-mentioned site would be
      <tt>ftp://ftp.myisp.com/username</tt>.</p> </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#solving_common_publishing_problems">Return to beginning of
section</a> ]</p>

<h3 id="checking_your_filenames">Checking Your Filenames</h3>

<p>Examine the names of any files that failed to publish. Make sure
that the filenames:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use only numbers or lowercase or uppercase letters. While
  it's acceptable to create filenames that use uppercase letters, you
  can avoid potential errors in later locating the published file if you
  only use lowercase letters in your filenames.

  <p>When you publish files to a web server, filenames become
  case-sensitive on the web server. It may be harder for you to remember
  files names that use only uppercase letters or that use a mix of
  uppercase and lowercase letters.</p>

  <p>For example, when you try to locate a published file by typing the
  filename's web address into Navigator's Location field, you must enter
  the filename exactly as you created it, using the same combination of
  uppercase and lowercase letters.</p> </li>

  <li>Don't use punctuation characters or spaces. Underscores ( _ ) or
  hyphens ( - ) are OK.</li>

  <li>End with .html or .htm (for KompoZer filenames).</li>

  <li>Use less than 32 characters.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixing_publishing_errors">Fixing Publishing Errors</h3>

<p>If one or more of your files fails to publish, look at the messages
KompoZer displays in the Publishing Status area of the
Publishing dialog box. You can use these error messages to help
determine what went wrong and what to do to fix the problem.</p>

<div class="errorMessage"> <p id="file_not_found"><strong>Error
Message:</strong></p>

<div class="errorBox">
  <tt><var>Filename</var> not found</tt>
  <p>or</p>
<tt><var>X</var> of <var>Y</var> files failed to publish</tt> </div>

<p><strong>Error Description:</strong> One or more image files or CSS
files failed to
publish because KompoZer could not find them. Some typical
reasons might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file location you typed is incorrect.</li>
  
  <li>The file's location on the web is not accessible.</li>

  <li>The file's location was changed or the file was deleted or moved
  to another
  location.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible Solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Look for broken images in the page you are trying to
  publish. Broken images will
  appear with this icon <img src="images/broken.gif" alt="" />
  in the page. To correct the image's address, double-click the
  broken image to
  display the Image Properties dialog box so you can enter the
  correct address.</li>

  <li>Remove the broken image from the page by selecting it (click
  once on the image),
  and then pressing Backspace or Delete on your keyboard.</li>

  <li>If the image is unavailable because the server where the image
  resides is
  inaccessible, try publishing the page at a later time.</li>

  <li>If the missing file is a CSS file, you must first verify the
  correct location of
  the CSS file. To fix the file's address in KompoZer, click
  the HTML Source tab and
  edit the file's location in the HTML source code. You should
  only edit the HTML source
  if you are familiar with HTML tags.</li>
</ul> </div>

<div class="errorMessage"> <p id="subdir_not_found"><strong>Error
Message:</strong></p>

<div class="errorBox">
  <tt>The subdirectory <var>directory name</var> doesn't exist on this

<p><strong>Error Description:</strong> You specified the name of a
remote subdirectory that
does not exist at the publishing site. KompoZer can only
publish to a remote subdirectory
that already exists at the publishing location. Or, you specified a
filename that is
identical to the name of an existing subdirectory at the publishing
site.</p>

<p>For example, in the Publish Page dialog box, under the Publish
tab:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for "Site subdirectory for this page", you may have typed the
  name of a subdirectory
  that does not exist at the publishing location.</li>

  <li>you checked "Include images and other files," and then you typed
  the name of a
  subdirectory that does not exist at the publishing location.</li>

  <li>one of the files you are attempting to publish has the same name
  as a subdirectory at
  the publishing site.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible Solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a separate FTP program if you want to create, rename, or
  delete subdirectories at
  the publishing site. Ask your service provider if they recommend a
  particular FTP
  program. You can usually find information on FTP programs in
  the Help or Support
  sections of your service provider's web site. FTP programs are
  also available from
  shareware sites such as ZDNet Downloads.</li>

  <li>Don't use subdirectory names that end with ".html" or
  ".htm". Only your KompoZer
  filenames should end with ".html" or ".htm".</li>

  <li>Subdirectory names are case-sensitive, so be sure to enter a
  subdirectory name exactly as it appears at the publishing location.</li>

<div class="errorMessage"> <p id="server_not_found"><strong>Error
Message:</strong></p>

<div class="errorBox">
  <tt>The server is not available. Check your connection and try again
later.</tt> </div>

<p><strong>Error Description:</strong> This error can have many
causes. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your publishing site settings may not be correct.</li>

  <li>Your Internet connection may have been lost.</li>

  <li>Your modem or other equipment that you use to connect to the
  Internet might not be
  functioning correctly.</li>

  <li>The web server that you are trying to publish to might be
  unavailable due to a
  technical problem or to an unknown circumstance.</li>

  <li>Your ISP or web hosting service may be experiencing technical
  problems.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible Solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Verify that your publishing settings are correct and that you
  entered them correctly.
  See <a href="#verifying_your_publishing_settings">Verifying Your
  Publishing Settings</a>
  for more information.</li>

  <li>Make sure your Internet connection is working by attempting to
  view a web page using
  the Navigator browser. For example, confirm that you can
  successfully view the page
  <tt>http://www.mozilla.org</tt>.</li>

  <li>If your Internet connection is not working, verify that all
  hardware, telephone
  connections, modems, and network connections are functioning
  properly.</li>

  <li>Use the Navigator browser to try to view a page at the web site
  you are attempting
  to publish to. If you can successfully view other web sites but
  cannot view a page at
  the publishing site, your ISP or web hosting service may be
  experiencing technical
  problems.</li>

  <li>Try publishing again later. Your ISP, web hosting service, or the
  web server may be
  experiencing temporary technical difficulties.</li>
</ul> </div>

<div class="errorBox">
  <tt>You do not have permission to publish to this location.</tt>
</div>

<p><strong>Error Description:</strong> You are attempting to publish
to a location that
you are not authorized to use. You can only publish to sites where

<p><strong>Possible Solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Verify that you entered the correct user name and password in
  the Publishing Site
  Settings dialog box, or in the Publish tab of the Publish dialog
  box.</li>

  <li>Contact your ISP to find out where you can publish your pages at
  their site.</li>

  <li>Find a web hosting service that you can use to publish your
  pages. In the Navigator
  browser, search for "web hosting".</li>

  <li>Use KompoZer My Webpage

Message:</strong></p>

<div class="errorBox">
  <tt>You are currently offline. Click the icon near the lower-right
  corner of any
window to go online.</tt> </div>

<p><strong>Error Description:</strong> You are attempting to publish,
but your KompoZer
Internet connection is currently in the "offline" state. Your

<p><strong>Possible Solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the online/offline icon to go online. In the online state,
  the icon should look
  like this: <img src="images/online.gif"
  alt="" />.</li>

  <tt>There is not enough disk space available to save the file
<var>filename</var>.</tt> </div>

<p><strong>Error Description:</strong> The remote web server's hard
disk is full, or you
may have exceeded the amount of disk space allocated to you by your
ISP or web hosting
service.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a separate FTP program to delete unnecessary files at your
  publishing site. Ask
  your service provider if they recommend a particular FTP
  program. You can usually find
  information on FTP programs in the Help or Support sections of
  your service provider's
  web site. FTP programs are also available from shareware sites
  such as ZDNet
  Downloads.</li>

  <li>Find out from your ISP or web hosting service about increasing
  your disk space
  allocation, or switch to a different service that can satisfy your
  needs.</li>

  <li>If the web server is located at your company or school, contact
  the network
  administrator to find out if you can publish to a different
  location that has more disk
  space, or if you can request that additional disk space be
  allocated to your current
  publishing location.</li>
</ul> </div>

<div class="errorMessage"> <p id="name_too_long"><strong>Error
Message:</strong></p>

<div class="errorBox">

  less than 32 characters.
  Some operating systems do not support names longer than 32
  characters.</li>
